# Pesticide_use

## The Goal:
For this Project I want to opserve Pesticides use in Agriculture for some Crops in the United States, I will be using data from https://hygeia-analytics.com/, the Data is specific crops that range from year 1999 to 2018. 

## data Cleaning:
The data includes all records for one crop for one year, I want to have all records for one crop for all years survied. For that I have to add a column of "year" to all tables and try to use R to rebuilt new Table, the Idea of using R is to utilize reading mutilple table that have similar names.
